    The current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.
    The current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.
    The open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.
    The previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.

    The actions you can perform fall into several categories:

    Page Operation Actions:
    `click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.
    `type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.
    `hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.
    `press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).
    `scroll [direction=down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.

    `go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).

    Completion Action:
    `stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as "N/A" in the bracket.
