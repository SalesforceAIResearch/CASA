The phrase \"giving a clock,\" \u9001\u949f( s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng), sounds exactly like \u9001\u7ec8( s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng), which means to send off someone to their death, symbolizing the end of relationships or life, hence they consider clocks as inappropriate gifts. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [N/A]```."
